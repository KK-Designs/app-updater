# UpdateHub

> ### Coming Soon!

### What is it?

UpdateHub is a user-friendly application designed to streamline the software update process for your computer or mobile device. With this app, you can quickly check for updates for all the software installed on your device, including operating systems and applications. The app's straightforward interface displays all available updates and lets you choose which ones to install, making the updating process quick and convenient.

### Why is it important?

Outdated applications can bring unwanted security threats. Take for example Git. On Feburary 25, 2023, Git faced multiple vulnerabilities. These included the following:

> - CVE-2023-22490 [Moderate]: Local clone-based data exfiltration with non-local transports
> - CVE-2023-23946 [High]: "git apply" overwriting paths outside the working tree
> 
> - (Windows only) - CVE-2023-22743 [High]: Git for Windows' installer is susceptible to DLL side loading attacks
> - (Windows only) - CVE-2023-23618 [High]: gitk can inadvertently call executables in the worktree

To fix this, you had to update to the latest version. But Git never tells you this, our app will.
\
You can also get new features bug fixes in apps, making your system potentially faster and better.
\
UpdateHub ensures that your device's software is up-to-date and secure, making updating as hassle-free as possible.

### What features does it have?

The app also features a rollback function. This feature means you can quickly revert to the previous version if you don't like an update or updated by accident.
Additionally, the app provides detailed information about each update, including release notes and version numbers, allowing you to stay informed about the changes and improvements made to your software.

### What makes this unique or better from others?
UpdateHub doesn't just update apps. It can update apps from the Microsoft Store and the whole operating system too.
\
It's also better than most other similar applications like this too. Here's a comparison between our app and IObit's solution:

\
In later updates, it will be able to keep your code dependencies up-tp-date if your a programmar and will allow you to keep custom files up-to-date with the specified source.

### Is it safe?
Absolutely! All apps/software downlaoded via this app are from trusted offical sources. They are also scanned by Windows Defender and have the security hash verified for every app downloaded to prevent unauthorized changes.
