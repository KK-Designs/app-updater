### What is it?

UpdateHub is a user-friendly application designed to streamline the software update process for your computer or mobile device. With this app, you can quickly check for updates for all the software installed on your device, including operating systems and applications. The app's straightforward interface displays all available updates and lets you choose which ones to install, making the updating process quick and convenient.

### Why is it important?

Outdated applications can bring unwanted security threats. Take, for example, Chrome. On April 21, 2023, Google Chrome faced multiple vulnerabilities. These included the following:

> **[21 April 2023]** Google Chrome (Desktop) - Zero-Day Vulnerability
>
> NIST: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-2033
> Type confusion in V8 in Google Chrome before 112.0.5615.121 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page. (Chromium security severity: **High**)
>
> Google Blog: https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2023/04/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_14.html
> Google is aware that an exploit for CVE-2023-2033 exists in the wild.
>
To fix this, you had to update to the latest version. But Google Chrome may not tell you this; our app will.
\
You can also get new features and bug fixes in apps and keep your OS and some drivers up-to-date, making your system potentially faster and better.
\
UpdateHub ensures that your device's software is up-to-date and secure, making updating as hassle-free as possible.

### What features does it have?

The app also features a rollback function. This feature means you can quickly revert to the previous version if you don't like an update or updated by accident.
Additionally, the app provides detailed information about each update, including release notes and version numbers, allowing you to stay informed about the changes and improvements made to your software.

### What makes this unique or better than others?
UpdateHub doesn't just update apps. It can also update apps from the Microsoft Store and the whole operating system.
\
It's also better than most other similar applications like this too. Here's a comparison between our app and IObit's solution. Look at how many more updates our app detects than the others:
UpdateHub (Detected 23 updates)            |  IObit (Detected 4 updates)
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:

\
In later updates, it will be able to keep your code dependencies up-to-date if you're a programmer and will allow you to keep custom files up-to-date with the specified source.

### Is it safe?
Absolutely! All apps/software downloaded via this app are from trusted official sources. Windows Defender also scans them and verifies the security hash for every app downloaded to prevent unauthorized changes.

### How much does it cost?
Completely free! If you like it, you can [donate](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=SRVM3LAZ3WBL8 "Donate") ❤️

### System Requirements
- Windows 10 1809 (17763) 64-bit or later
- 250 MB of available RAM
- 500 MB of available disk space (250 MB minimum)

<h5>You probably already have these, but in case you don't here</h5>
<ul>
	<li><h5>Winget v1.4.11071 or later
	<li><h5>Powershell 5.1 or later</h5></li>
</ul>

### MacOS/Linux support?

Currently, we do not support MacOS and Linux. A plan to support it is coming in later updates.

### Where do I download it?
You can download it for free [here](https://github.com/KK-Designs/UpdateHub/releases/latest "Download latest version").
