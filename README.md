### What is it?

UpdateHub is a user-friendly application designed to streamline the software update process for your computer or mobile device. With this app, you can quickly check for updates for all the software installed on your device, including operating systems and applications. The app's straightforward interface displays all available updates and lets you choose which ones to install, making the updating process quick and convenient.

### Why is it important?

Outdated applications can bring unwanted security threats. Take, for example, Git. On February 25, 2023, Git faced multiple vulnerabilities. These included the following:

> - CVE-2023-22490 [Moderate]: Local clone-based data exfiltration with non-local transports
> - CVE-2023-23946 [High]: "git apply" overwriting paths outside the working tree
> 
> - (Windows only) - CVE-2023-22743 [High]: Git for Windows installer is susceptible to DLL side loading attacks
> - (Windows only) - CVE-2023-23618 [High]: gitk can inadvertently call executables in the work tree

To fix this, you had to update to the latest version. But Git never tells you this; our app will.
\
You can also get new features and bug fixes in apps, making your system potentially faster and better.
\
UpdateHub ensures that your device's software is up-to-date and secure, making updating as hassle-free as possible.

### What features does it have?

The app also features a rollback function. This feature means you can quickly revert to the previous version if you don't like an update or updated by accident.
Additionally, the app provides detailed information about each update, including release notes and version numbers, allowing you to stay informed about the changes and improvements made to your software.

### What makes this unique or better than others?
UpdateHub doesn't just update apps. It can also update apps from the Microsoft Store and the whole operating system.
\
It's also better than most other similar applications like this too. Here's a comparison between our app and IObit's solution:
UpdateHub             |  IObit

\
In later updates, it will be able to keep your code dependencies up-to-date if you're a programmer and will allow you to keep custom files up-to-date with the specified source.

### Is it safe?
Absolutely! All apps/software downloaded via this app are from trusted official sources. Windows Defender also scans them and verifies the security hash for every app downloaded to prevent unauthorized changes.

### How much does it cost?
Completely free! If you like it, you can donate ❤️

### System Requirements
- Windows 10 1809 (17763) 64-bit or later
- 250 MB of available RAM
